ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! Iâ€™m a fullstack software engineer passionate about solving unanswered questions and building things from 0 to 1. Over the past 3 years, I have worked at various fast-paced, early-stage AI startups. Currently, Iâ€™m a founding engineer at [Flagship](https://about.flagship.shop/), an e-commerce startup backed by Sequoia Capital, where I build machine learning-powered recommendation systems to help influencers discover and sell tailored products.

My work focuses on using machine learning and LLMs to create elegant, impactful AI products that empower informed decision-making and facilitate knowledge acquisition, with applications across business operations, education, and e-commerce. I aim to advance human decision-making and knowledge acquisition through emerging AI technologies.

Outside of tech, I perform stand-up comedy regularly and occasionally dabble in improv comedy and arts. As a creative myself, I am also interested in unleashing human creativity with human-computer interaction (HCI).
